## Introduction

This web application provides a comprehensive analysis of drug use, identifying key contributing factors, demographic impacts, and future trends. By leveraging machine learning and statistical analysis, it delivers actionable insights to inform prevention and intervention strategies.

## Problem

Drug use is a complex and widespread societal issue with significant consequences. Understanding the multifaceted factors that contribute to drug use, including demographic influences, lifestyle choices, and other variables, is essential for effective intervention. Traditional analysis methods often struggle to uncover the intricate patterns hidden within large datasets.

## Importance of Project

This project is vital because it:

* **Provides Data-Driven Insights:** Utilizes advanced analytics to reveal hidden patterns in drug use data.
* **Identifies Key Contributing Factors:** Pinpoints significant variables, demographic impacts, and lifestyle factors associated with drug use.
* **Enables Demographic Analysis:** Analyzes drug use across genders and age groups, facilitating targeted support.
* **Offers Future Predictions:** Forecasts future drug use trends, aiding in proactive planning and resource allocation.
* **Ensures Accessible Information:** Makes complex data accessible to researchers, professionals, and the general public through a user-friendly interface.
* **Supports Preventative Measures:** Allows for proactive risk mitigation by understanding contributing factors and future trends.

## Main Objective

The primary objective is to develop a web application that:

* Analyzes drug use data using machine learning and statistical methods.
* Visualizes significant variables, demographic impacts, and lifestyle factors.
* Provides detailed demographic analysis by gender and age.
* Presents analysis results through a user-friendly web interface.
* Forecasts drug use trends for the next three years.
* Calculates and displays the R2 value for each variable to determine its relationship strength.
* Provides confidence intervals for the average age of the dataset.
* Offers actionable research recommendations based on the analysis.
* Provides all analysis in English.

## Methodology

The application's methodology encompasses:

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
    * Generating or loading a large dataset containing drug use-related variables.
    * Transforming categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
    * Handling missing data to ensure data integrity.

2.  **Statistical Analysis:**
    * Calculating R2 values to measure the strength of the relationship between variables and drug use.
    * Ranking variables by R2 values to identify significant contributors.
    * Calculating confidence intervals of the age variable.

3.  **Demographic Analysis:**
    * Analyzing drug use prevalence across different genders and age groups.
    * Utilizing R2 values to determine the most affected age ranges within each gender.

4.  **Predictive Modeling:**
    * Training predictive models to forecast drug use trends over the next three years.
    * Forecasting overall drug use prevalence and prevalence within specific demographic groups.
    * Predicting the strength of each variable's contribution in the future.
    * Predicting drug use prevalence within specific age intervals.
    * Predicting which lifestyle factors will be most affected.

5.  **Lifestyle Factor Analysis:**
    * Analyzing the impact of various lifestyle factors on drug use.
    * Identifying the most influential lifestyle factors contributing to drug use.

6.  **Web Application Development:**
    * Developing a Flask web application to host and present analysis results.
    * Designing a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.
    * Utilizing data tables, charts, and visualizations to present findings.
    * Displaying R2 values, demographic impacts, and future predictions.
    * Displaying the confidence intervals of the age variable.
    * Providing all analysis in English.

7.  **Visualization and Reporting:**
    * Presenting analysis results in a clear and concise manner.

    * Visualizing trends and patterns with charts and graphs.
    * Providing actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Interpretation of Mental Illness Analysis (Example)

Based on a sample analysis of mental illness, the following interpretations were derived:

* **Overall Prevalence:**
    * Among 10,000 surveyed individuals out of a population of 100,000, the average population age ranged from 48.16 to 48.87.

* **Key Findings:**
    * The most significant health symptom contributing to mental illness was "isolation," followed by "anxiety."
    * The least significant health symptoms were "chronic\_illness" and "depression."
    * The most significant contributing factors were "income" and "age."
    * The least significant contributing factors were related to specific job types, such as "job\_type\_Unemployed" and "job\_type\_Office".
    * The most affected age group was 18-30, followed closely by 31-50.
    * The lifestyle factor contributing the most was "diet_quality".

* **Symptom Contributions:**
    * "Isolation" and "anxiety" showed the highest importance in symptom contributions.
    * "Chronic\_illness" and "depression" showed the lowest importance.

* **Classification Report:**
    * The model achieved an accuracy of 0.5.

* **Top Contributing Factors:**
    * "Income," "age," "stress\_level," "diet\_quality," and "sleep\_hours" were the top contributing factors.

* **Least Contributing Factors:**
    * Specific job types showed the least contribution.

* **Mental Illness by Age Group:**
    * The prevalence of mental illness was slightly higher in the 18-30 and 31-50 age groups.

* **Lifestyle Factors:**
    * "Diet\_quality" was the most influential lifestyle factor, followed by "alcohol" and "smoking."

## Researcher Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided:

* Target interventions towards the most affected demographic groups identified in the analysis.
* Focus on addressing the significant contributing variables and lifestyle factors.
* Implement proactive measures based on future predictions to mitigate potential increases in drug use.
* Develop and implement educational programs that address the most affected lifestyle factors.
* Develop and implement educational programs that address the most affected age groups.
* Develop and implement educational programs that address the most affected gender.
* Develop and implement educational programs that address the most significant contributing variables.
